This repository contains the [Enquo](https://enquo.org) "core" library for all supported languages.
It provides basic cryptographic operations and support functions which can be used to build higher-level integrations with ORMs and application development stacks.

Each supported language provides the same functionality, and as such we maintain a common versioning scheme across all languages.
Details of how to build, install, and use each language's library should be contained in the README in that language's subdirectory.

# Contributing
